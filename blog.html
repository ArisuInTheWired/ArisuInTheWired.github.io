                Entry 02: Western democraties are collapsing and nobody cares
            </h2>

            <p>
                I cannot stand the fact that fascism is rising everywhere, the USA are collapsing and nobody seems to care about it.
                Even if you don't live in the US (like me), this will have consequences for you too: the US are central to most economies 
                and if you live in Europe, fascism is already there and everything happening in the US tends to arrive +/- 5 years later in europe. 
                But instead of revolting, people are too preoccupied by their entertainment, living like nothing will change and everything is normal.
                It's like decades of liberal and neoliberal propaganda have fried the brains of most people, 
                and they are thinking that everything will always be alright. <br> <br>
                So please, riot against what is happening, build or join mutual-aid networks and prepare ways to resist the system.
                Lots of people asks themselves what they would have done during the rise of Hitler in 1930's Germany, but this isn't a hypothetic question anymore:
                we are living in a similar situation and how you are currently acting is how you would have acted back then.

                Entry 01: why science is broken but still the best system to gather knowledge
            </h2>
        

        <p>
            The moderne scientific method is based on 2 flawed assumptions: 
            the past predicts the future, and the there is a material world behind the qualia we have. <br> <br>
            
            The first assumption is quite simple to understand: every protocol, studies made using the current sientific methodology 
            uses past data to predict future effects and extract patterns.
            But there are no reasons in the universe why that should be true. 
            The issue is worse than it seems when you think about it. We can't prove or disprove our assumption.
            Without recursively making the assumption that the past predicts the future. <br> <br>

            The second assumption is more philosophical. The scientific method has as it premise the fact that our observation
            comes from a real, material world. But it isn't a trivial thing. 
            Kant, Descartes and many other philosophers have discussed this very question
            (does anithing exist beside my qualias) but no one has a real answer. This is a frustrationg realisation, but we can't prove that their is 
            a real world behind our own senses. <br> <br>

            Why that isn't a big deal? If we want to predict or understand anything, those two assumptions are a requirement. 
            Also, any methodology will have some assumptions that can't be proved or disproved; this is also the case in more formal fields like
            mathematics or logic. But studiing the hidden assumptions behind the scientific method still interesting and can open our eyes on other
            assumptions we make everywhere, even in our daily lives.
